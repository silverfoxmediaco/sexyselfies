# Test Credits System - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ Backend Implementation

### Models
1. **Member.js**
   - Added `testCredits` field (Number, default: 0, min: 0)
   - Tracks test credits balance for QA/development testing

2. **Transaction.js**
   - Added `isTestTransaction` boolean flag (default: false)
   - Added `test_credits` to payment method enum
   - Allows tracking and filtering test vs real transactions

### Admin Controllers & Routes
Created `admin.testCredits.controller.js` with 8 endpoints:

- `POST /api/admin/test-credits/grant` - Grant test credits to a member
- `POST /api/admin/test-credits/deduct` - Deduct test credits from a member
- `POST /api/admin/test-credits/set` - Set exact balance for a member
- `POST /api/admin/test-credits/bulk-grant` - Grant to multiple members at once
- `POST /api/admin/test-credits/reset-all` - Reset all test credits (QA cleanup)
- `GET /api/admin/test-credits/balance/:memberId` - Get member's balance
- `GET /api/admin/test-credits/members` - List all members with test credits
- `GET /api/admin/test-credits/transactions` - View test transaction history

All routes require admin authentication and log actions for audit trail.

### Payment System
**payment.controller.js**
- Created `processContentUnlockWithTestCredits()` function
- Validates test credits balance
- Deducts test credits from member
- Creates test transaction (flagged as `isTestTransaction: true`)
- Unlocks content for member
- Updates creator earnings (marked as test)
- Adds content to member's unlocked library

**payment.routes.js**
- Added `POST /api/payments/unlock-content-test` route

### Safety Features
- Test credits capped at $10,000 maximum per member
- Test transactions clearly flagged in database
- Test earnings tracked separately (won't affect real payouts)
- All admin actions logged for audit trail
